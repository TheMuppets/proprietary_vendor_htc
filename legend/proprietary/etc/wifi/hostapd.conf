# multiple hostapd processes/interfaces can be run at the same time if more

# run as non-root users. However, since the control interface can be used to
# change the network configuration, this access needs to be protected in many
# cases. By default, hostapd is configured to use gid 0 (root). If you

# Station inactivity limit
#
# If a station does not send anything in ap_max_inactivity seconds, an
# empty data frame is sent to it in order to verify whether it is
# still in range. If this frame is not ACKed, the station will be
# disassociated and then deauthenticated. This feature is used to
# clear station table of old entries when the STAs move out of the
# range.
#
# The station can associate again with the AP if it is still in range;
# this inactivity poll is just used as a nicer way of verifying
# inactivity; i.e., client will not report broken connection because
# disassociation frame is not sent immediately without first polling
# the STA with a data frame.
# default: 300 (i.e., 5 minutes)

# Enable/disable internal bridge for packets between associated stations.
#
# When IEEE 802.11 is used in managed mode, packets are usually send through
# the AP even if they are from a wireless station to another wireless station.
# This functionality requires that the AP has a bridge functionality that sends
# frames back to the same interface if their destination is another associated
# station. In addition, broadcast/multicast frames from wireless stations will
# be sent both to the host system net stack (e.g., to eventually wired network)
# and back to the wireless interface.
#
# The internal bridge is implemented within the wireless kernel module and it
# bypasses kernel filtering (netfilter/iptables/ebtables). If direct
# communication between the stations needs to be prevented, the internal
# bridge can be disabled by setting bridge_packets=0.
#
# Note: If this variable is not included in hostapd.conf, hostapd does not
# change the configuration and iwpriv can be used to set the value with
# 'iwpriv wlan# param 10 0' command. If the variable is in hostapd.conf,

# Note: If wpa_psk_file is set, WPS is used to generate random, per-device PSKs

# set wpa_psk_file when using WPS with WPA-PSK).

# When an Enrollee requests access to the network with PIN method, the Enrollee
# PIN will need to be entered for the Registrar. PIN request notifications are
